a class in summer: scheme calculator

This is an individual project for CS119 Principles and Practice of Computer Algorithms in the second semester. 
In this project I realize the calculation part of the algorithmic language "Scheme", which is a dialect of the Lisp programming language invented at the MIT AI Lab. 

Specifically, this job requires the following:

Equal judgment:	equal?, string=?, string-ci=?, char=?, char-ci=?
Type conversion:	number->string, string->number, char->integer, integer->char
Computation:	See below
String operation:	string?, make-string, string, string-length, string-ref,   string<? string-ci<?, string<=? string-ci<=?, substring, string-append, string-copy
Character operation:	char?, char<? char-ci<?, char<=? char-ci<=? char-alphabetic?, char-numeric?, char-whitespace?, char-upper-case?, char-lower-case?, char->integer, integer->char, char-upcase, char-downcase

Basic arithmetic operations:	+, -, *, /, abs, quotient, remainder, modulo, gcd, lcm, expt, sqrt
Fractional calculation:	numerator, denominator
Approximation:	floor, ceiling, truncate, round
Accuracy:	inexact->exact, exact->inexact, exact?, inexact?
Judgments：	<, <=, >, >=
Judgments：	zero?, negative?, positive? odd? even?
Min Max: 	max, min
Trigonometric function:	sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
Power and logarithm:	exp, log
Complex operations:	make-rectangular, make-polar, real-part, imag-part, magnitude, angle
Type judgment:	integer?, rational?, real?, complex?, number?
